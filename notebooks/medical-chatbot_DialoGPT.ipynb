My advice to you is, you should focus on maintaining normal levels of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and try to remain active, having a positive outlook in life. Or else, it will become very difficult to balance your life with the symptoms of hypothyroidism. Even though your weight has not reduced, be very careful in not putting on weight here afterward. Everyday brisk walking for 1 hour. If you have body pain, alternate with exercises and walking. Avoid all kinds of junk foods, processed, bakery products, rich sweets, fatty foods, sodas, alcohol, and smoking. Avoid partying and binge eating. Follow the food timings properly. Have small frequent meals. In between snacks should be strictly fruits or any kind of low-calorie foods. Have unsalted nuts around five daily. It can give a glow to your dry skin.

But after a surgery like what you had, or any significant stress or use of lots of antibiotics (as would have happened after surgery) or use of steroids or diabetes, all infections show an altered balance between good and bad bacteria. You do not need any treatment for this. Just wait for your body to develop those good bacteria, and gradually, all tests will come negative. If you have any symptoms, treat as per need.

So to prescribe you a correct homeopathic remedy I need to understand your mental, emotional, and physical state.

I welcome you to icliniq. Well it is not uncommon to have Gastric upsets after a course of antibiotic. And antibiotic like augmentin are notorious to cause this. This occur secondary to effect of augmentin on decreasing the amount of lactobacillus microorganism which are normally present in the human gut and help digest the food. You should take yougurt, Kefir (fermented yougurt), Kefir. and there are certain diets with probiotic activity you can start taking it. Plus take Tab Ecotec twice daily for 4 weeks, and Tab Levosulpiride 75 mg once daily half hour before meals.for 2 weeks. You can continue with acinil O syp. while rest of your current medication can be stopped. I hope this will correct your microbiota and will bring the same healthiness as before. good day Antibiotic induced dysbiosis Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth Antibiotic induced dysbiosis Let me know in one week time how you respond to above regimen, if persistent of symptoms I would consider testing and giving some safe antibiotic therapy for 2 weeks.'},\n {'patient_question': '## Patient: Q. Can a painless tooth be extracted since it has a hole in it?',\n  'doctor_answer': '## Doctor: Hello. I had gone through your question, and I can understand your concern. If the pain occurs only when you eat food and it gets stuck into it, it is reversible pulpitis. For that, you do not need to get it extracted. You need to get it filled, and it will cost you less than that of pulling (extraction). Second, you will save your tooth too. My suggestion is to get dental filling done as soon as possible. If you want to get it removed, you need to visit a doctor (dentist), and there will be no pain because during extraction local anesthesia is given.'},\n {'patient_question': '## Patient: Q. What does the darker pigmentation at the armpits indicate?',\n  'doctor_answer': '## Doctor: Hello. I understand your concern. The pictures are a bit hazy. But from the given images, it looks like a fungal infection by the name of pityriasis versicolor. I would also need to see your chest, upper back, and shoulders to be sure. Kindly send clear photos of the same to make a conclusive diagnosis. Meanwhile, you can start using the following medicines. 1. Tab Fluconazole 400 mg start and repeat once after a week. 2. 2 % Ketoconazole lotion apply for 5-7 mins and wash off once a day.'},\n {'patient_question': '## Patient: Q. I get fever during rainy and winter season. Why?',\n  'doctor_answer': '## Doctor: Hello. I need to know a few things, 1. Do you feel feverish, or does the thermometer record a temperature? 2. What other symptoms do you get? Runny or blocked nose, sore throat, throat pain with swallowing, headaches, body pains, etc. 3. Does anyone else around you (family members, co-workers, etc.) develop similar symptoms before or after you do? 4. Do you get any tests done like blood tests or X-rays during those episodes? From your description, it appears that you are getting frequent viral upper respiratory tract infections. These are acquired from other patients through the air (coughing, sneezing, etc.). They are usually short-lived and last no more than five to seven days. Since more than 300 different viruses can cause similar symptoms, you can get infected multiple times each time with a different virus. The same virus cannot affect you again. Unfortunately, antibiotics do not work against viruses. They are meant for bacterial infections only. However, doctors continue to prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily, and this has led to the emergence of widespread bacterial resistance.  Other than symptomatic treatment, no medicine can cure or prevent these infections. They are self-limited, and you will get better even if you do not take any medication. The older you get, the less frequently you will get these infections as your body will be building up defenses with every disease. No household tips or vitamin supplements have been proven to work. Premature birth can lead to increased frequency of infections, but unless the infections are bacterial, not much can be done about them. Please get back to me with answers to the above questions and also attach any test reports you may have.'},\n {'patient_question': '## Patient: Q.
